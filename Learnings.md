# :pencil: Learnings
Working on this project has been a great experience for me :smiley:. 

I got to apply my existing skills which helped in consolidating my knowledge. 
Plus I got to learn so many new things while building this project.  
So, here are the key learnings I gained through this project.

 ## :hotel: Domain (Hospitality)
 
 1.	The **average Cancellation Rate** in the Hospitality Industry is **24%**, which means that almost one-fourth of the room reservations get cancelled.  
Also, there is a term called `Lead Day` which is basically `the number of days between booking and check-in`. And, **there is a positive correlation between Lead days and the Cancellation Rate**. Thus, more the number of days a customer is due to check-in, higher the prospect of cancellation.

2.	Two new metrics that I came across which are used in this industry: `ADR (Average Daily Rate)` and `RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)`. `ADR is the average rate hotels can charge for a room` on any given day. `RevPAR is calculated as ADR * Occupancy Rate`. While ADR is used to measure a hotelâ€™s profitability, RevPAR is used to measure its overall performance as it takes into consideration both the daily rate and daily Occupancy. Also, **none of the metric should be used in isolation**. One should look at these metrics holistically to optimise revenue management strategies.

3.	The **average Occupancy Rate** in this industry broadly varies **between 65% and 70%** and is very seasonal in nature. Also, Weekends have higher Occupancy rates compared to Weekdays.


## :bar_chart: Data Analytics

1.	**Data Modelling should be done properly**.  
 Once you establish the right relationships between the given tables, slicing and aggregating the data on different levels becomes so much easier.  
And, **a Star schema can also have 2 fact tables**. To be able to perform aggregations on the measures contained in both tables, you need to establish a relationship between them on all the common dimensions.
 
2.	New things in Tableau
 -	**Condition based Count** using IF statement
 -	**Removing Zero** from the Axis. However, it is always a good idea to include it as its exclusion can lead to distorted view of the data.
 -	**Adding Filters** that apply to all the elements of the Dashboard and **their Formatting**
 -	Using the **Detail card** to break down data by a specific dimension
 -	Using the **Story feature of Tableau** to put together multiple navigable sheets and create a data narrative

3.	**Choosing the right kind of graph to communicate your point clearly and effectively**.  
There are a bunch of graphs out there but you need to select which one would get your message across in the most effective way. And for this, you need to be clear with your goals. A graph can help you with
 -	analysing trends
 -	finding out patterns and outliers
 -	understanding how different parts affect the whole
 -	making comparisons
 - 	finding out relationships between different variables  
 So, **being clear with the goal can really help with the chart selection**.
             
             
I hope to work on more of such projects and build my knowledge and skillset in Data Analytics ðŸ˜„
